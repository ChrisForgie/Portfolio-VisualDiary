# Portfolio-VisualDiary

This is an application created with Unity3D and written in C# aimed at iPad use, it is a prototype for a visual diary application. The project 
started off at a local GameJam (Jamming for Small Change 2013) with a team of five people, it was intended to be an application 
used by people with Alzheimers and their family & friends. It is a comic book style diary with the user able to add new
entries, an entry is a "event" that the user has experienced; they can input their own day-to-day events and view them at a 
later time. When creating an event, the user is shown various locations to choose from, select people which were present and any props
that were used or could be used to demonstrate the event.

Building upon the assets that were created at the GameJam event, I rebuilt the entire application from the ground up. Initially 
a third party extension was used with Unity3D as 2D image support wasn't available in the IDE at this time. Now that Unity has
added support for 2D sprites and collisions, I was able to rebuild the application to its original intended design.
